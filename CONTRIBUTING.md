2. [Register](https://l10n.spgoding.com/accounts/register) by linking your GitHub account (recommended), or using your email.
    - Note that the username and email will be shown in the [repository](https://github.com/SPGoding/datapack-language-server)'s git commit log. If you don't feel like you want to disclose your own email address, feel free to [contact SPGoding](https://github.com/SPGoding/datapack-language-server/wiki/Contact-SPGoding) to get an account with a fake email address.
